# Data

This directory is critical for housing both the raw and processed datasets utilized throughout the project. It is structured to separate the original data from the transformed data to ensure clarity and ease of access for all project stages.

# Raw Data

Location: Data/raw-data/

This subdirectory contains the original, unmodified data files as they were collected or received. These files are essential for transparency and reproducibility, allowing project participants and reviewers to understand the baseline from which all analyses begin.

# Processed Data

Location: Data/processed-data/

This subdirectory includes data that has been cleaned, transformed, or otherwise processed for direct use in the project's analyses. The primary file here is an RDS file, which is used extensively throughout the project for various analyses and modeling efforts.
